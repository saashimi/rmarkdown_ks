Code chunks are delimited by:
```{r} STUFF ``` OR ctrl+alt+i

Chunk options can be customized with knitr options.
include = FALSE prevents code and results from appearing in the finished file. R Markdown still runs the code in the chunk, and the results can be used by other chunks.
echo = FALSE prevents code, but not the results from appearing in the finished file. This is a useful way to embed figures.
message = FALSE prevents messages that are generated by code from appearing in the finished file.
warning = FALSE prevents warnings that are generated by code from appearing in the finished.
fig.cap = "..." adds a caption to graphical results.
